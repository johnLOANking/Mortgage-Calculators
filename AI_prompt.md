# Mortgage-Calculators

Here's an improved prompt that incorporates URL parameters and creates an interview-style interaction:

I need to build a mortgage calculator widget that will be hosted on GitHub Pages. Please help me create a comprehensive solution by asking me questions about my requirements. I want to incorporate:

1. Alpine.js for interactive functionality
2. Version parameters for cache busting
3. Responsive design for all devices
4. JSON data loading from GitHub-hosted files
5. Easy embedding in ClickFunnels 2.0
6. URL parameters for pre-filling calculator fields
7. Clear documentation and maintainability

Instead of creating the solution immediately, please first interview me, by asking one question at a time and waiting for a response before asking the next question.
The interview should be about:
- The specific type of mortgage calculator I want to build
- What inputs are required and which should be available via URL parameters
- What outputs or results I need the calculator to display
- Which JSON data files I need to reference (rates, fees, etc.)
- My preferred styling approach
- Any additional features I might need (like saving results or generating PDFs)
- My technical comfort level with JavaScript and GitHub
- Any ClickFunnels 2.0 specific considerations
- Performance or SEO requirements
- Any existing calculators I want to emulate or improve upon

Once you understand my needs, please provide the complete code structure with explanations for implementing this as a GitHub Pages widget."

This prompt will ensure you get a tailored solution with URL parameter support, while the interview process will uncover all your specific requirements before any code is written.
